							<h2>Our Mission</h2>
							<p>Beat the Streets – San Francisco Bay Area aims to provide a supportive forum for girls and boys to build their discipline, self-esteem, develop their personal motivation, and cultivate a can-do attitude through the sport of wrestling.

								<div class="motto">“Anyone can wrestle, and </br>everyone who wrestles is a <b>winner</b>.”</div></p>

					<h2>Beat the Streets - San Francisco</h2>
					<p>
						Beat the Streets - San Francisco ran two locations in the Spring of 2014: Marin City Rec Center and Francisco Middle School in downtown San Francisco. The program is open to 5th-9th grade aged girls and boys and is free to participate.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program leverages the acquisition of basic wrestling skills and teamwork in order to help kids achieve positive results in life, on and off the mat. Wrestling is the means, not the end.
					</p>
					<p>
						Beat the Streets – San Francisco Bay Area teaches children critical life skills including health, nutrition, physical fitness, emotional stability and resilience, confidence, and goal setting. Wrestling stands alone in the pantheon of sport as the world’s oldest, most basic, and perhaps most beautiful due to its simplicity: two humans, no equipment. An emotionally, mentally, and physically demanding sport, wrestling engages the athlete in a unique way. The program is focused similarly on engaging each child in a way unique to youth athletics.
