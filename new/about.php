						Beat the Streets began as a middle school wrestling program in New York City in 2005. The goal: get youth back on their feet, in touch with their bodies, and motivated about life. The program quickly grew from one school to sixty-five with 1250 kids participating. The program has changed the lives of its participants, and motivated kids with regard to school. It is an outstanding program that offers children an avenue to productively utilize after-school time.

						The healthy human body is a precious resource, but all too often children spend their free time engaged in unhealthy pursuits such as watching television simply because they donâ€™t have the means or the tools to engage in more fulfilling and healthy activities. Wrestling allows a child of any size and weight to gain more appreciation for the potential of their bodies and use the new-found knowledge to help launch them on a fulfilling life filled with goals and purpose.
